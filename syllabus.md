\setstretch{1}

**Location**: 

**Time**: 

**Instructor**: Dr. Tad Dallas (tdallas@mailbox.sc.edu)

\setstretch{1.5}


**Course Overview**:


Parasitism is the most common trophic strategy on Earth, and many crucial issues in ecology involve outbreaks of harmful diseases. Research on the ecology of infectious diseases has increased tremendously in recent years, fueled by challenges to global human health and ecological conservation as well as advances in theory and molecular technologies. This course introduces major issues and advances in the ecology of infectious diseases. This course will specifically focus on the functional and taxonomic diversity of parasites, transmission routes of parasites, parasite virulence and strategies of host defense, mathematical models for the population dynamics of disease, the effects of parasitism on individual hosts and populations, disease in complex communities, co-evolution between hosts and parasites, emerging, and resurging diseases, and human impacts on disease emergence. 


\bigskip





**Course Goals**:

Over the course, it is expected that students gain

+ an appreciation for the diversity of parasite types, transmission modes, and impacts on host populations and communities
+ a working knowledge of what influences host-parasite interactions (both from host and parasite perspective)
+ 
+ an ability to read and understand primary literature 



\bigskip


**Textbook**:
There will be no textbook for this course, but we will instead read primary literature to complement lecture material. You must read these papers in enough detail to be able to discuss them, and we will have quizes on the content. 




**Syllabus Subject to Change**:

Changes to the syllabus may be made during the semester. The most up-to-date and current syllabus will always be available on the course website (on Github). 







## Course format

There will be a total of 500 points, consisting of 4 assignments, 2 exams, weekly quizes, and some attendance/participation points. 



**Undergraduate-level grading**

| Item | Points | Total |
| -- |  ---  | :---: |
| Assignments | 4 x 50 | 200 |
| Attendance/Participation | 50 | 50 |
| Weekly quizes | 50 | 50 |
| Mid-term exam | 100 | 100 |
| Final exam | 100 | 100 |



**Graduate-level grading**

| Item | Points | Total |
| -- |  ---  | :---: |
| Assignments | 4 x 50 | 200 |
| Attendance/Participation | 50 | 50 |
| Weekly quizes | 50 | 50 |
| Mid-term exam | 100 | 100 |
| Final exam | 100 | 100 |







## Assignments: 

All assignments are due by immediately before the start of class on the day indicated. Assignments should be submitted as instructed. Assignments are not collaborative, and I expect that each student will complete the assignment independently. 




## Late Assignments: 

All assignments are expected to be electronically submitted by the due date. I will not accept any assignment that is submitted after the deadline and the assignment will receive the grade of 0. This course is an upper-level class and you are expected to work at the appropriate level and be responsible for your work. All deadlines are posted with the syllabus or any changes will be announced ahead of time.



## Attendance: 

Much of the material presented will not be available if you aren't in class to hear it. You should come to class. If you do not, you may struggle. Part of the class will be discussing relevant papers. If you do not participate in paper discussions, clearly demonstrating that you have read and understand the nuances of the work, this will affect your grade. Attendance and participation will be worth 50 points. 




## Weekly quizes

There will be weekly quizes that will cover material in the required reading for the week. These will consist of 1-3 questions, and are designed as a useful check-in to gauge what folks took away from the reading that week. These will likely happen on Tuesday, meaning that before the first class of the week, students will have had to do the reading for that week. 





## Exams

There will be two exams, roughly distributed as a mid-term (covering modules 1 and 2) and a final exam (covering modules 3 and 4). Exams will be worth 100 points, will be completed in class, and will be closed book/notes. 


The mid-term exam will be **Tuesday, March x - 4:00pm**.
The final exam will be **Tuesday, May x - 4:00 pm**.









## Academic honesty

Cooperation has a limit. You should not copy your code or answers directly with other students. Feel free to discuss the problems with others, but write your own solutions. Penalties for cheating are severe -- they range from a zero grade for the assignment or exam up to dismissal from the University, for a second offense. Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course! If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy any answers.

You are expected to practice the highest possible standards of academic integrity. Any deviation from this expectation will result in a minimum academic penalty of your failing the assignment, and will result in additional disciplinary measures. This includes improper citation of sources, using another student's work, and any other form of academic misrepresentation.

The first tenet of the Carolinian Creed is, "I will practice personal and academic integrity."



## Diversity and inclusion

The university is committed to a campus environment that is inclusive, safe, and respectful for all persons, and one that fully embraces the Carolinian Creed. To that end, all course activities will be conducted in an atmosphere of friendly participation and interaction among colleagues, recognizing and appreciating the unique experiences, background, and point of view each student brings. You are expected at all times to apply the highest academic standards to this course and to treat others with dignity and respect.

## Accessibility, disability, and triggers 

I am committed to ensuring course accessibility for all students. If you have a documented disability and expect reasonable accommodation to complete course requirements, please notify me at least one week before accommodation is needed. Please also provide SDRC 

https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_disability_resource_center/

documentation to me before requesting accommodation. Likewise, if you are aware of cognitive or emotional triggers that could disrupt your intellectual or mental health, please let me know so that I can be aware in terms of course content. 
Diversity, Ethics, and the Carolinian Creed [credit to Dr. David Moscowitz]
This course works to foster a climate free of harassment and discrimination, and it values the contributions of all forms of diversity. The decision to enter university and pursue advanced study is a choice that entails commitment to personal ethics expressed in the Carolinian Creed (www.sa.sc.edu/creed): "I will discourage bigotry, while striving to learn from differences in people, ideas and opinions." Likewise, the Student Code of Conduct (STAF 6.26 (http://www.sc.edu/policies/ppm/staf626.pdf) stresses, "The University of South Carolina strives to maintain an educational community that fosters the development of students who are ethical, civil and responsible persons." 


## Title IX and gendered pronouns 

This course affirms equality and respect for all gendered identities and expressions. Please don't hesitate to correct me regarding your preferred gender pronoun and/or name if different from what is indicated on the official class roster. Likewise, I am committed to nurturing an environment free from discrimination and harassment. Consistent with Title IX policy, please be aware that I as a responsible employee am obligated to report information that you provide to me about a situation involving sexual harassment or assault. 




## Disability services

Student Disability Resource Center (http://www.sa.sc.edu/sds/): The Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC) empowers students to manage challenges and limitations imposed by disabilities. Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact me to discuss the logistics of any accommodations needed to fulfill course requirements (within the first week of the semester). In order to receive reasonable accommodations from me, you must be registered with the Student Disability Resource Center (1705 College Street, Close-Hipp Suite 102, Columbia, SC 29208, 803-777-6142).
