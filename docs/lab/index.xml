      <description>Student Learning Outcomes At the end of this lab, a successful learner should be able to…&#xA;Describe the overall structure of the laboratory course, expectations for laboratory conduct, and how their grade is assessed Successfully demonstrate how to use a compound light microscope, including loading specimen slides, focusing at multiple magnifications, calculating total magnification, and to accurately measure the size of objects under magnification Label the basic parts of a compound microscope and be able to explain their function Define parasitism (in an ecological sense), identify major parasitic groups of interest, and outline some of the life history strategies lumped together under the term “parasite” Distinguish morphological differences separating major groups of helminth parasites across multiple life stages, and apply that knowledge to identify unknown specimens Pre-Lab Materials Review the course syllabus before coming to lab.</description>

      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s lab is a field trip! We&amp;rsquo;ll be sampling for ticks at Sesquicentennial state park. I&amp;rsquo;ve directly emailed you all with full information about times, where to meet, etc. Make sure to check it!&#xA;Aside from participating in sampling, the worksheet also asks you to read Shapiro et al., 2017 to prepare for our class discussion of it next week!&#xA;Presentation No presentation this week; we&amp;rsquo;re in the field!</description>
