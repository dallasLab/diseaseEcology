Describe the overall structure of the laboratory course, expectations for laboratory conduct, and how their grade is assessed Successfully demonstrate how to use a compound light microscope, including loading specimen slides, focusing at multiple magnifications, calculating total magnification, and to accurately measure the size of objects under magnification Label the basic parts of a compound microscope and be able to explain their function Define parasitism (in an ecological sense), identify major parasitic groups of interest, and outline some of the life history strategies lumped together under the term “parasite” Distinguish morphological differences separating major groups of helminth parasites across multiple life stages, and apply that knowledge to identify unknown specimens Pre-Lab Materials Review the course syllabus before coming to lab.</description>

Define common vocabulary used to describe parasite life cycles (Simple complex, tropic transmission, parasitic castrator, parasitoid, vector-borne).
Describe the life histories of a few major parasites of importance to human or wildlife health (malaria, schistosomiasis, trophically transmitted cestode, simple life cycle nematode, Guinea Worm, Chytrid…)
Apply their knowledge of parasite life cycles to develop targeted intervention strategies, and develop methods to evaluate their performance</description>
