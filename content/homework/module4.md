### 1 

Calculate $R_0$ for a pathogen with transmission rate of 0.5 and recovery rate of 0.4, assuming $SIR$ style dynamics. What happens to $R_0$ when we introduce an exposed class and set the transition from exposed to infected ($\omega$) to be 0.6?




### 2 

Add vaccination into the SEIR model as presented in the lecture notes, show how to format the F and V matrices for the next-generation method of estimating $R_0$, and estimate $R_0$ given the parameters $\beta$ = 1.1, $\gamma$ = 0.25, $\omega$ = 0.5, and $v$ = 0.3. 



### 3 

How could you incorporate land use change into the standard SIR modeling framework we went over in class? How about the role of superspreaders?
