title: "Module 4 homework"
---


1) Discuss the $c_{ij}$ parameter in Dobson 2004 American Naturalist paper (i.e., what is it? what do i and j stand for?). For a pathogen that can transmit across host species and within a host species effectively, what does $c_{ij}$ look like? 


2) Describe all the main proposed mechanisms underlying the _dilution effect_. Using literature we went over in class and from other sources (google scholar), write 4-5 sentences about the current state of diversity-disease relationships (in your reading, look for papers discussing 'additive' versus 'substitutive' experimental designs and discuss those)


3) Lauren is studying flour beetles which are infected by an ectoparasitic mite and an intestinal nematode. She wants to be able to tell if the two parasites are interacting within coinfected host individuals, and futher to differentiate 'top-down' from 'bottom-up' effects. How could she do this? 



4) In class, we went over 5 potential mechanisms for the dilution effect (diversity-disease relationships, but one-sided). Describe two of them and how they work. 



5) What is 'friendly competition' and how does it work? 


6) What is apparent competition as it pertains to disease systems (as discussed in lecture)? 



7) With respect to diversity-disease relationships, we went over an example in amphibians from Piet Johnsons work. Describe how/why community composition mattered in this system. Did they find evidence for amplication or dilution effects? Why? 




8) Describe the transmutation problem as it could apply to something we have learned about in class. 


9) Describe the mid-domain effect, specifically with regards to parasite distributions and some patterns we could observe in terms of parasite species richness. 



10)
