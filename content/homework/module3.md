### Homework problems

1) How are the models of vector-borne parasites different from those of directly-transmitted parasites? 


2) When modeling sexually-transmitted disease, we observe a large variation in resulting infection time series (x-axis is time, y-axis is number of infected hosts). There were at least two reasons for this. What were they? 


3) How do we incorporate information about sexual transmission into our estimates of $R_0$? 


4) A waterborne pathogen has been affecting a local population. Public health officials are trying to figure out the best way to control it. Based on the SIRP model we went over, there are at least two clear strategies for control. Describe them, and the conditions that might favor one control over the other. 


5) Public health officials are worried about the role of climate change on a mosquito-borne parasite. Drawing from what you learned about thermal performance curves, what types of information would public health officials need to have before estimating the impact of climate change on $R_0$? (draw figures if it helps explain)


6) The climate may also become more variable as a consequence of climate change. What are the implications to the mosquito-borne disease above in the face of increasing climate variability? (draw figures if it helps explain). When would variability reduce/increase potential for an epidemic? 


7) The Ross-MacDonald model posits that $R_0$ is controlled by a number of parameters. What the two most important parameters for control efforts, and how would we implement control measures to reduce infectious disease burden? 



8) Using examples from class, describe how vector host preferences influence vector-borne disease transmission. 


9) During a vector-borne disease outbreak, you have the ability to reduce (by proportional amounts) host transmission rate ($b_v$) or mosquito attack rate ($a$). Which do you select and why? 


10) We talked about the best traits for a sexually-transmitted disease to have. What are some of the traits that would make the 'perfect' vector-borne disease (perfect in the sense that the disease is able to establish, spread, and persist)?
