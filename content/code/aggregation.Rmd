### We don't only care about prevalence 

+ <font color='green'> Prevalence </font>: fraction of the population infected (infection is binary here)

+ <font color='green'> Intensity </font>: the number of parasites within an infected host (_how_ infected is the host?)





---

### Why do we care about intensity? 

+ <font color='orange'> outcomes </font> (death is more likely if you have more parasites)

+ <font color='orange'> transmission potential </font> (transmission is more likely when you have more parasites)

+ <font color='orange'> mitigation targets </font> (who do we treat?)

---

### Transmission potential 

+ <font color='green'> supershedders</font>: high infection burden can lead to shedding lots of pathogen in the environment (increases transmission rate) 

+ supershedding is different than superspreading 

+ Transmission potential increases for both external parasites and internal parasites 

+ Even for sexually-transmitted infections (so transmission goes up, even though contact does not change; $\beta = c*a$




---

### An example of HIV 

Higher viremia means higher transmission potential

---

### But once symptoms start, contact goes down 

There is nuance here, as transmission depends on contact and infectivity

Saturating transmission potential (there's only so many parasites you can have before transmission potential saturates)

---

### Mitigation 

> If we can identify phenotypes of heavily infected individuals, we can target treatment 



---

### Target high-risk individuals 

+ could estimate social contact network (variation in contact rate $c$)

+ or could use measures associated with burden (and subsequently probability of infection)

  + so vaccinate based on which individuals you think are either highest risk or would have the highest burden if infected 








---

### Targeted vaccinations of highly central individuals 

+ Knowing social network structure helps vaccination 

+ Even using traits to target vaccination still works better than random

### What causes variation in infection intensity within a host population?

+ host sex

+ time of exposure

+ superinfection 

+ home range size 

+ immune function

---

### Time of exposure 

+ If all host individuals were equal, there could still be aggregated parasite burdens 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

df <- data.frame(day=1:100, burden=6+sort(log(rexp(100))))

plot(df$day, df$burden, type='b', 
  pch=16, xlab='Day of infection', 
  ylab='Burden', col='dodgerblue')

```

### Timeline of infection

---

### Simulated data to show how this matters 

What happens if all hosts are equivalent and timing of exposure is the same? 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

layout(matrix(1:2, ncol=2))
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1))
hist(sample(df$burden[1:10], 1000, replace=TRUE), 
  main='All hosts in first 10 days', 
  xlab='Burden', breaks=15, xlim=c(0,9))

hist(sample(df$burden, 1000, replace=TRUE), 
  main='Random sample', 
  xlab='Burden', breaks=15, xlim=c(0,9))


```

### Does not really happen though

<sub> Tinsley et al. 2020 _Parasitology_ </sub> 







---

### Superinfection 

<font color='green'> Superinfection </font> is when an infected individual is exposed again to a parasite, and it infects.

+ This serves to increase pathogen burden in infected hosts, as it disrupts the infection timeline by adding more parasites to an individual. 

+ This effect is pronounced when hosts vary in their exposure probability, such that some individuals just have a higher risk of exposure and resulting superinfection.

---

### What have we learned so far? 

+ There is variation in parasite burden within a population 

+ This variation is related to host traits 









---

### Parasite aggregation 

+ This variation in infection intensity (aka parasite burden) gets at the fundamental idea that <font color='green'> parasites are aggregated within host populations</font> 

<div class="notes">

</div>








---

### What does infection intensity mean for microparasites and macroparasites? 

+ Viremia (viral load)

  + Infectious copies per ml (blood) or g (host tissue)

+ Ectoparasite burdens 

  + Count of individual parasites (sometimes standardized by host weight) 






---

### How do we measure parasite aggregation? 

+ Variance-mean ratio 

+ Negative binomial fit ($k$)

+ Mean crowding 

+ Patchiness 

+ Poulin's $D$ 

+ Hoover's index

---

### Variance-mean ratio 


Variance divided by the mean 

\[ VMR = \dfrac{\sigma^2}{\mu} \]







--- 

### Negative binomial distribution 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=4}

layout(matrix(1:3, ncol=3))
hist(rnbinom(1000, size=2, prob=0.4), main='mu=2', 
  xlab='Parasite burden', col='dodgerblue', las=1, breaks=25)
hist(rnbinom(1000, size=5, prob=0.4), main='mu=5',
  xlab='Parasite burden', col='dodgerblue', las=1, breaks=25)
hist(rnbinom(1000, size=10, prob=0.4), main='mu=10',
  xlab='Parasite burden', col='dodgerblue', las=1, breaks=25)

```

\[ k = \dfrac{(\mu^2 - \sigma^2)/N}{(\sigma^2 - \mu^2)} \]









---

### Mean crowding 



\[ m* = \dfrac{\sum x^2_j}{\sum x_j} - 1 \]






---

### Patchiness

\[ P = \dfrac{m*}{\mu} \]






---

### Poulin's D

\[ D = 1 - \dfrac{2\sum^N_i=1 \sum^i_j=1 x_j}{\mu N(N+1)} \]





---

### Hoover's index 

\[ H = \dfrac{\sum^N_i=1 |x_i - \mu | }{2\sum^N_i=1 x_i}  \]

### What causes variation in infection intensity between host species for the same parasite?


+ other stuff. 

+ trait distributions of hosts 

+ phylogenetic bits 

+ parasite specificity

<div class="notes">
This is not just aggregated burden in a single host population, but trying to compare variation in infection intensity across host species, where the parasite is the same, but can infect a bunch of different host species.
