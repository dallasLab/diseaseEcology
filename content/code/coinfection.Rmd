### Community epidemiology 

+ mult-host, multi-parasite interactions in a community context

![](figs/coinf0.png){width=100%} 





---

### Multi-host parasites 

+ One parasite that infects multiple host species (recall previous lectures)

+ Can be either at species (rabies) or individual (mosquitos) level 





---

### Host-predator-prey 

+ Predator eats prey, prey gets infected by parasite 

+ Important in a couple ways:
  + trophic transmission 
  + healthy herds 



---

### Trophic transmission 

+ consumption of prey is necessary for the parasite to advance life cycle
+ the parasite infects the predator as well 

![](figs/complexLifeCycle.png){width=60%}


---

### Healthy herds 

+ Predators might eat prey non-randomly 
+ Sickness behaviors leave prey weaker or more isolated from groups
+ The consumption of infected prey by the predator could reduce disease burden in the host population 





---

### Co-infection 

+ The same host individual is infected by more than one parasite species 

+ Extremely common 

![](figs/nestedInfra.png){width=80%}








--- 

### Co-infection 

+ Do parasites interact?

+ Through what mechanisms? 
  + <font color='green'> bottom up </font> (e.g, competition)
  + <font color='green'> top down </font> (e.g, immune-mediated)

+ How do interactions within infected hosts affect population-level patterns? 




---

### Coinfection can result in non-linear changes to 

+ disease severity
+ host survival 
+ parasite replication and shedding
+ design of control programs





---

### Detecting parasite-parasite associations

---

### Types of interactions 

<font color='green'> Bottom-up </font>
+ Within-host competition for resources or space 
+ Ecological interference via reduced contact or density 

<font color='green'> Top-down </font> 
+ Facilitation via host defenses (HIV and opportunistic infections)
+ Indirect competition via host defenses (e.g., immune priming or cross protection)










---

### How do we estimate the effect of coinfection? 

+ Either parasite species richness (treats infection by parasite $i$ as binary) or an estimate of infection intensity for each coinfecting parasite 

+ Hosts with lots of parasites are not necessarily the ones with highest burdens 
  + If parasites compete or that host is mounting a strong but failing immune response 

+ The effect of host traits, geography, etc. need to be considered
  + We'll get into a conceptual framework for thinking about coinfection later 



---

### Some definitions before we start to conceptualize how this works 

+ <font color='green'> Infracommunity </font>: all the parasite species within a single infected host 

+ <font color='green'> Component community </font>: all the parasite species within a host population (basically a local estimate of parasite species richness for a species)








---

### Let's start with a null model 

+ Null models incorporate no ecological process

+ They make really simple assumptions that provide good benchmarks 

> What would the distribution of coinfection look like if all hosts were equally probable of getting infected and all parasites were distributed independently? 





---

### So we'll start with assumptions 

+ All hosts equally likely to be infected 
+ All parasites are distributed independently

### Uses of null models to understand host-parasite communities

---

### Incorporating non-random processes could lead to expected differences 

+ So what could we incorporate into our null to address this? 

> - Covariance between parasite distributions (some hosts are more likely) 
> - Incorporate host traits like body size (big hosts more parasites) 
> - other stuff

---

### A conceptual framework of coinfection

---

### Exposure 

+ geography 

+ behavior 

+ host traits 








---

### Susceptibility 

+ genetics (immune or defense traits)

+ diet 

+ costs of immunity 

+ microbiome
