### Introductions 

I can start this off. Then we can go around the room, thinking about

+ what you want to get out of the course
+ any worries/feelings/questions/concerns about the course
+ your favorite parasite



---

### A bit about me 

+ my background is quantitative disease ecology
+ started with ticks and small mammals
+ host-parasite interactions are incredibly interesting, parasites are gross. 
+ [lab research here](https://taddallas.github.io)





---

### A bit about course structure 

+ lecture (3 hrs) + lab (1 hr)
+ structure of lecture
+ structure of lab
+ [course website](https://dallaslab.github.io/diseaseEcology/syllabus/)






---

### Syllabus

Work through syllabus, clarify structure, etc. 

- [syllabus](https://dallasLab.github.io/diseaseEcology/syllabus/)


_why is the website called "diseaseEcology" if this is a "parasitology" course?_







---


### Course website 

Go through the course website and make sure everyone has easy access and is clear on how to get the lecture notes, readings, and homeworks.

### What is parasitology? 

+ The study of parasites and parasite-related disease
+ The difference between parasites and disease
+ Parasitology, disease ecology, and epidemiology 












---


### How many parasites are there? 

+ Around 40% of species diversity 

+ Incredibly varied in life history

+ Tough to say
  + We keep finding more
  + [Sampling is limited](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33203333/) 
  + Depends on what you want to call a parasite (viruses?)
  + Guesses range around 6 to 10 million species 
  








---

### Why are parasites important? 

+ Regulation of population and community dynamics 
  + Classic Hudson work ([population cycles as function of parasitism](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9856948/))
  
+ They are costly (human health, economic loss, etc.)

+ [Use of parasites as biocontrol](https://csiropedia.csiro.au/myxomatosis-to-control-rabbits/)

+ An interesting ecological interaction (why study plant-pollinator interactions?)







--- 

### The idea of parasite conservation 

+ Parasites are incredibly diverse, and may represent a lot of extinctions 

+ How/why do parasites go extinct? 

+ [Which parasites should be conserved?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320719319937)
  + tough to advocate for parasites which threaten human health or which threaten animal populations
  






---

### What is the difference between parasites and disease? 

+ Parasitism is being infected by a parasite. 
+ Disease is defined as the expression of symptoms related to the parasite. 


> So the parasite causes disease, but these terms should not be confused. 










---

### Why do we care about infectious disease? 

+ Impact on biodiversity 

+ Economic importance

+ Impacts on humans

### Zoonotic parasites

+ A zoonotic parasite is a parasite that can infect humans. 

+ Let's name some zoonotic parasites 

+ Let's define some terms
  + spillover
  + emergence
  + re-emergence









--- 

### Koch's postulates

+ Microorganism must be present in diseased individuals and absent in healthy individuals.

+ Microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture.

+ Cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism.

+ Microorganism must be re-isolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.







---

### Limitations of Koch's postulates

+ Super important when originally introduced for characterizing disease (TB, cholera, etc.)

+ Many infectious diseases subvert the posulates
  + some pathogens can't be cultured yet (e.g., many prion diseases)
  + asymptomatic folks (e.g., Koch himself saw this with cholera)
  + low prevalence of infection given inoculation (hence the 'should' in postulate 3, which was previously 'must')

### Let's have a good semester 

+ We're going to learn a lot

+ Stay on top of readings

+ Ask when you have questions

+ Have fun
