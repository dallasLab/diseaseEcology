### What is vector-borne disease? 

+ A micro- or macroparasite transmitted among vertebrate hosts by an arthropod vector 

+ Vector-borne diseases represent some of the deadliest, most impoverishing diseases of mankind and wildlife

### Vectors

### Vectors 

![](figs/vectors.png){width="100%"}






---

### Importance of vector-borne disease 

+ Vectors are flying syringes 

+ Host preference determines encounter 

+ Huge economic cost 

+ Some rough diseases 




---

### Vectors are flying syringes 

+ Vectors take blood or host tissue (including pathogen) and transmit to same (or different) species

+ Means reservoir hosts are really important 



---

### Host preference determines encounter 

+ Vectors prefer certain hosts, and host preference determines the resulting disease burden

---

### Huge economic cost 

+ $12 billion per year (Chilakam et al. 2023 doi:10.2196/50985)

+ $100 billion economic costs per year ([USDA-ARS report](https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/annual-report-on-science-accomplishments/fy-2019/mitigating-impacts-of-vector-borne-diseases/))

+ More important is the cost in terms of impacts to human and wildlife

### Some rough diseases 

Mosquitos 

+ Malaria, Dengue, West Nile, Chikv, Zika, yellow fever, 

Ticks:

+ Lyme, E equine encephalitis, Ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mtn spotted fever, Tularemia 

Other: 

+ Plague (fleas), Chagas (Tiatome bugs), Schisto (aquatic snails), Sleeping sickness (Tsetse flies)





---

### Plague

+ _Yersinia pestis_, a bacterial pathogen

+ Vectored by fleas 

+ Killed 25% of Europe's pop in 1300's

+ Exists in enzootic cycles with transmission between rodents and fleas


---

### Lyme disease

+ _Borrelia burgdorferi_, a bacterial pathogen 

+ Vectored by ticks (_Ixodes scapularis_ as main vector)

+ Ancient disease (plagued humans prior to European Colonization)

+ Disappeared around 1850's due to deforestation



---

### Lyme disease

---

### Mosquito-borne disease is different 

+ Dengue (33%+ of world pop at risk) 

+ Chikungunya (45 countries affected)

+ Zika (61 countries affected, 47 in Americas) 

+ Malaria (kills ~1 million people per year)

### Does this mean climate change is 'good'? 

+ Mixed, but probably not 

+ How could it be _good_? 

+ Why is it especially _not good_ for us?

<div class="notes">
Yellow dots on light grey means a known occurrence was not predicted by the model. And projected distributions under climate shifts don't generally move the vector into much more new territory. Points to need for better models.

### the bigger question is...

<br> 
> if the vector species are already here, why is the pathogen not found as often? 

This points to either the importance of the <font color='green'> reservoir host community </font> or <font color='green'> environmental control of pathogen presence </font> 





---

### This is not to say that vector-borne disease is not increasing in the US 

+ Some diseases we were already struggling with (e.g., Lyme; 20-30k cases per year) 

+ Some we are now starting to grapple with (e.g., Zika; local transmission back in 2016-2017, but not since) 

+ Some are right around the corner (e.g, Dengue; local transmission in Florida, Texas and Arizona)

### The role of vector preference on resulting disease dynamics 

![](figs/vectorSpec2.png){width="85%"}






---

### The role of vector preference on resulting disease dynamics 

<font color='green'> Important</font> because:

+ Vector feeding preferences are particularly important for multi-host systems

+ Can introduce variation in exposure across different groups of individuals within a host population

+ Vector preference can inform intervention strategies based on vector and reservoir communities

### But let's not be silly about it 

![](figs/treeBatEbola.png){width="100%"}


---

### But let's not be silly about it 

+ Response to this (and other bat-vectored disease) is to try to kill bats 

+ Often killed the wrong bats

+ Some efforts potentially increased disease in humans

Bats may be likely for more infectious diseases in humans. There are many emerging diseases that start in bats. But this article details how land use change is one of the largest drivers of this emergence. So burning trees is not really a solution.

### Parasite manipulation of host behavior

1. _Plasmodium_ can direct uninfected mosquito blood-seeking and feeding behavior via alteration of vertebrate-host odor profiles and production of phagostimulants 

2. Plasmodium also manipulates its vector during the sporogony cycle to increase transmission (infected mosquitos bite more and take longer bloodmeals)


> So the malaria pathogen can shift host preferences and increase transmission rates through manipulation of host behavior
