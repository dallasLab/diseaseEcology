## Student Learning Outcomes

At the end of this lab, a successful learner should be able toâ€¦

1. Modify an epidemic model to include or remove compartments
2. Draw a flow diagram to represent a compartmental model given a system of equations describing that model
3. Given a flow diagram model, write a system of equations describing that system
4. Explain the basic assumptions of the SIR model, and identify cases when violations of those assumptions may make it an inappropriate modeling choice.
