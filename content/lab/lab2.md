## Student Learning Outcomes

At the end of this lab, a successful learner should be able toâ€¦

1. Define common vocabulary used to describe parasite life cycles (simple, complex, tropic transmission, parasitic castrator, vector-borne). 

2. Describe the life histories of a few major parasites of importance to human or wildlife health (malaria, *Schistosoma spp*, *Ascaris lumbricoides*, Guinea Worm, etc.)

3. Apply their knowledge of parasite life cycles to develop targeted intervention strategies, and develop methods to evaluate their performance

4. Identify samples of *Schistosoma spp* across life stages and the tissues or environments they are likely to be found in.
