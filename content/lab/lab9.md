This week's lab is a field trip! We'll be sampling for ticks at Sesquicentennial state park. I've directly emailed you all with full information about times, where to meet, etc. Make sure to check it! 

Aside from participating in sampling, the worksheet also asks you to read [Shapiro et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003489) to prepare for our class discussion of it next week!
