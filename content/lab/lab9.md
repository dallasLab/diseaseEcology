This week's lab is a field trip! We'll be sampling for ticks at the Saluda Riverwalk. I've directly emailed you all with full information about times, where to meet, etc. Make sure to check it! The pre-lab quiz this week is on the tick sampling methods video. 

Aside from participating in sampling, the worksheet also asks you to read [Shapiro et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003489) to prepare for our class discussion of it next week!
